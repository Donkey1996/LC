669. Trim a Binary Search Tree
Medium

Given the root of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as 
low and high, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in [low, high]. 
Trimming the tree should not change the relative structure of the elements that 
will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant). 
It can be proven that there is a unique answer.

Return the root of the trimmed binary search tree. 
Note that the root may change depending on the given bounds.
